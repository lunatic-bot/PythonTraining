# Python Training Repository

Welcome to the **Python Training** repository! This repository contains the code and presentations used during Python training sessions conducted for a group of interns. The focus of this training was on Python programming, data manipulation, and data visualization.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Python Programming
- **Introduction to Python**: Overview of Python programming language, its features, and why it's widely used.
- **Data Types**: Understanding different data types in Python such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- **Control Flow**: Using conditionals (`if`, `else`, `elif`), loops (`for`, `while`), and how to control the flow of programs.
- **Exception Handling**: Techniques to handle errors and exceptions gracefully in Python using `try`, `except`, `finally`.
- **Functions**: Writing reusable blocks of code with functions, understanding arguments, return values, and scope.

### 2. Data Manipulation
- **Pandas**: Introduction to the pandas library for data manipulation, including DataFrames, series, and data handling techniques such as filtering, grouping, and aggregating.
- **Numpy**: Working with the numpy library for efficient numerical computations, array manipulations, and mathematical operations.

### 3. Data Visualization
- **Pandas Visualization**: Creating basic visualizations directly from pandas DataFrames.
- **Matplotlib**: Exploring `matplotlib` to create plots such as line charts, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
- **Seaborn**: Advanced data visualization using `seaborn` for statistical plots, including heatmaps, pair plots, and violin plots.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PythonTraining.git
2. Install the required libraries:
